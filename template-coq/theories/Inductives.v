(** We use this function to filter the subterm information for arguments applied to a match, stored in the [stack], to 
  what is allowed to flow through a match, obtaining the stack of subterm information for what would be applied to 
  the match branches after the match is reduced. 
  [rtf] is the return-type function of the match (aka the match predicate). 

  Assuming that the return-type function has the shape 
    [λ x, ∀ (x1 : T1) (x2 : T2) .... (xn : Tn). T]
  where x is applied to the discriminant of the match, 
  we allow the subterm information to the applicants corresponding to the xi to flow through,

      [Ti = ∀ y1 ... yn let z1 ... let zm := _ in IND t1 t2 ... tk]
    (where the prods and lets can appear in arbitrary permutations) and IND is an inductive type.
    In that case, we infer an approximate recargs tree for IND applied to t1 .... tk and 
    intersect it with the subterm tree of xi in the stack. TODO: make this more precise
  All other subterm information is truncated to Not_subterm.
