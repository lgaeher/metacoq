(** The guardedness checker works by recursively traversing terms and checking recursive guardedness syntactically.
  The main data structure it works off are regular trees/recursive trees.
  These are computed for every inductive type by the Coq kernel's positivity checker. 
  Essentially, they capture the recursive structure of inductive types. 
  (more precisely, they describe all "well-founded paths", i.e. all paths of how an inhabitant of the inductive type can be constructed -- the positivity checker makes sure that there are no infinite "unguarded" paths)

  A recursive tree always contains the trees for a whole mutual inductive block (to account for recursive occurrences).
  The top-level node is a [Rec n], having children for each of the mutually defined types, and describing the recursive structure for the [n]-th type (starting at 0) of this block.

  For lists, there is exactly one mutually inductive block.

  Each of the node for the mutually defined types is annotated with the name of the inductive and has children for each of the constructors.
  The nodes for the constructors are not annotated with anything useful, the Norec does not mean anything. 

  Each of the nodes for the constructors has children for each of the non-parametric arguments. 
  The [nil] constructor obviously has no children. 
  The [cons] constructor has two children. 
    
  The nodes for the arguments are [Norec] if their type does not involve one of the mutually defined types.
  They are [Param i j] for recursive occurrences of types.
  The index [i] refers to the number of [Rec]s up in the tree this refers to (in de Bruijn style). 
    (this can only be non-zero with nested inductives) 
  The index [j] refers to the index of the inductive type in the corresponding block of mutual inductives. 
*)
  

(** Nested inductives need special attention: to correctly handle matches (and subterms) on elements of a nested inductive type we are doing recursion over, the inner inductive type's parameters need to be properly instantiated with the outer inductive type. This is in particular the case for the recursive arguments tree. *)
(** Example: rose trees
   [Inductive rtree (X : Type) := rnode (l : list (rtree X)).]
   When we check a fixpoint which is structural over [r : rtree X] and (after matching) [r] ≃ [rnode l], 
    we want to be able to do recursive calls with elements of [l]. 
   In order to obtain this subterm information when matching on [l], the recargs tree for the [list] type is instantiated with [rtree] beforehand.

(** When matching on a (loose) subterm of the recursive argument of a fixpoint, we can look in the recursive tree whether a
  particular binder introduced by a match branch is a subterm. *)

(** There are many more complicated behaviours in relation to matches: *)
(** - Matches can be subterms if all branches are subterms. 
    However, this is restricted for dependent matches, depending on the return-type function/match predicate.*)
Fail Fixpoint abc (n : nat) := 
  match n with 
  | 0 => 0
  | S n => abc (match n with | 0 => n | S n => S n end)
  end.
Fixpoint abc (n : nat) := 
  match n with 
  | 0 => 0
  | S n => abc (match n with | 0 => n | S n' => n end)
  end.

MetaCoq Run (check_fix abc). 

(** - If matches are applied to some arguments, we "virtually" apply those arguments to the branches (technically, the checker maintains a stack of such virtual arguments). 
    
    The subterm information of these which is allowed to flow into branches of the match is restricted, too, for dependent matches. *)


(** If we encounter nested fixpoints and apply this nested fixpoint to a subterm of the outer fixpoint (at the position of the recursive argument), we may assume in the body of the inner fixpoint that the recursive argument is a subterm of the outer fixpoint. 
  In this way, we can make recursive calls to the outer fixpoint in the inner fixpoint (see the rosetree example below).
